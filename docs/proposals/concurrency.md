# [WIP] Hook Execution Priorities

This document outlines the design for parallel hook execution using explicit priority levels.

## Motivation

By default, `prek` executes hooks sequentially. While safe, this is inefficient for independent tasks (e.g., linting different languages). This proposal introduces per-hook priorities to allow safe, parallel execution of hooks.

## Configuration

### Hook Configuration: `priority`

A new optional field `priority` is added to the hook configuration.

```yaml
- id: cargo-fmt
  priority: 10
```

*   **Type**: `u32`
*   **Default**: `None` (auto-populated by hook index)

When `priority` is omitted, the scheduler assigns the hook a priority equal to its index in the configuration file, starting at `0`. This preserves the current sequential behavior by giving each hook a unique, increasing priority by default.

## Execution Model

Execution is driven purely by priority numbers:

1. **Ordering**: Hooks run from the lowest priority value to the highest.
2. **Concurrency**: Hooks that share the same priority execute concurrently, subject to the global concurrency limit (default: number of CPUs).
3. **Defaults**: Without explicit priorities, each hook receives a unique priority derived from its position, so execution remains sequential and backwards-compatible.
4. **Conflicts**: If two hooks intentionally share a priority, they will be run in parallel. Users are responsible for assigning priorities that match their desired grouping.

## `require_serial` Clarification

The existing `require_serial` configuration key often causes confusion. In this design, its meaning is strictly scoped:

* **`require_serial: true`**: Controls **file chunking**. It tells `prek` to pass all files to the hook in a single process invocation, rather than splitting them into multiple chunks/processes.
* **It does NOT imply exclusive execution**. A hook with `require_serial: true` can still run in parallel with other hooks that share its priority.
* If a hook *must* run alone (e.g., it modifies global state), it should be assigned a unique priority value that no other hook uses.

## Design Considerations

### Output Buffering

To prevent interleaved output from parallel hooks, `prek` must buffer the stdout/stderr of each hook. Output is printed only when:

1. The hook completes (successfully or failed).
2. Or, for a smoother UX, we might print "started" lines immediately but hold the result details until completion.

### Fail Fast

If `fail_fast` is enabled:

* If a hook fails, `prek` should wait for currently running hooks with the *current priority* to finish, but **abort** the execution of higher-priority groups.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: local
    hooks:
      - id: cargo-fmt
        name: Format Rust
        entry: cargo fmt
        language: system
        priority: 0  # Earliest priority, runs first

      - id: ruff
        name: Lint Python
        entry: ruff check
        language: system
        priority: 10 # Same number means concurrent execution

      - id: shellcheck
        name: Lint Shell
        entry: shellcheck
        language: system
        priority: 10 # Runs parallel with ruff

      - id: integration-tests
        name: Integration Tests
        entry: just test
        language: system
        priority: 20 # Starts after the lint group completes
```
